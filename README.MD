# Send email with  PYTHON

The application was developed with python, being a big challenge since I am still in the learning process, but fortunately I was able to develop it so it is possible to send email.


### Run application

```npm 
git clone https://github.com/AntonioLourencos/MailPython.git
```

open the folder and then.

```npm
python3.9 ./src
```
